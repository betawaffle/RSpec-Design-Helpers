RSpec-Design-Helper is a gem that enhances RSpec for the simple first steps of BDD. 

When the need for a class first appears, you can easily generate failing specs that describe the interface to your class. 

## implements
Specifies that the #example under test must implement the specified methods. 

class FailingUser
end

class PassingUser
  def name
    "Billy Chatteroonski"
  end

end

describe FailingUser do
    implements :name # One spec fails. A FailingUser.new does not have a :new method
end

describe PassingUser
    implements :name # One spec passes. A PassingUser.new has a :new method.
end
